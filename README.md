# EquipmentTypePrediction
Given the FMCSA and Carrier dataset, predict the different equipment types for a Carrier

The repo has three Python Notebooks in the Python Code folder:
1. EDA.py : This provides and exploratory data analysis and cleaning of the input data.
2. MLModels.py:  This provides different models for the problem along with feature selection and different performance criteria.  A detailed explanation of the model and performance criteria are discussed in the notebook.
3. ClusteringModel.py:  This provides another approach for the problem where we first solve a clustering model to develop some features to be used in the classification problem.  Details of the approach are provided in the notebook.
